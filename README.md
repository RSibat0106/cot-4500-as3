Assignment 3a - Numerical Methods for Differential Equations

# Description

This assignment covers numerical methods for solving differential equations, focusing on Euler's Method and the Runge-Kutta Method. The goal is to explore how solution accuracy and stability can be controlled by selecting appropriate numerical methods.

# Requirements

To receive full credit, ensure the following:
Maintain the expected project structure.
Include this README with compilation instructions.
Ensure that every output for each question is correct.

# Compilation Instructions
# Running the Python Script
Ensure you have Python installed
This script is compatible with Python 3.13.

You can check your Python version by running:
python --version  
# Example output: Python 3.13.0

Navigate to the script directory
Open a terminal or command prompt and change to the directory where the script is saved:
cd /path/to/your/script

# Run the script using Python

Execute the script by typing:
python assignment3a.py

# Dependencies

This script only uses built-in Python functions, so no external libraries are required.
A requirements.txt file is not needed unless additional libraries are introduced.
In this code, no additional libraries were introduced; since this assignment was coded in raw python.

# Expected Output

Upon successful execution, the program will output numerical approximations for Eulerâ€™s and Runge-Kutta methods:
Euler Method Result: 1.2446380979332121
Runge-Kutta Method Result: 1.2513165878789806

Ensure that these values match the expected results provided in the assignment prompt.

1.2446380979332121

1.2513165878789806

# Restrictions

The SciPy library is not permitted for this assignment. You must implement the numerical methods manually without using external solvers.

# Troubleshooting

If you encounter an error, ensure you are using Python 3.13 and that the script is saved with a .py extension.
Double-check indentation and syntax to ensure proper execution.
For any questions, refer to the assignment guidelines or contact your instructor.
